        <p>
        My name is Connor Young and I'm from Palo Alto, CA. I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Business from Cornell University
        and a Master's in Operations Research and Information Engineering from Cornell Tech. 
        <br /><br />
        I seek opportunities to understand and balance customer needs with engineering constraints to deliver
        innovative and high-value products. I greatly enjoy fast-paced work environments with high levels of
        collaboration, accountability, and room for impact and growth.
