        <div class='text-center mx-auto w-3/5'>
        <p>
        My name is Connor Young and I'm from Palo Alto, CA. I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Business from Cornell University
        and a Master's in Operations Research and Information Engineering from Cornell Tech. 
        <br><br>
        I seek opportunities to understand and balance customer needs with engineering constraints to deliver
        innovative and high-value products. I greatly enjoy fast-paced work environments with high levels of
        collaboration, accountability, and room for impact and growth.
        <br><br>
            I've got a lot of hobbies - in my free time, I play adult league flag football and lacrosse, play piano and guitar, ride my motorycle,
            and like to get outside to golf, ski, fly fish, and more. Check out below for some photos from my life and activities!
