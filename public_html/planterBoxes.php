            <p>I approached the Menlo Park VA because I knew I wanted my Eagle Project to benefit veterans. They told me that many of their residents love
                 to garden, but are wheelchair-bound and have difficulty doing so. Thus, I designed and constructed three wheelchair-accessible planter boxes.</p>
            <p>The boxes were constructed out of redwood with a plywood sheet bottom for added strength and cost savings. The inside was sealed with 
                caulk and then covered in plastic sheet with a spigot attached for drainage. Finally, the boxes were mounted on wheels, sanded, and stained.</p>
            <p>This was a really fun project and great learning experience for me. I got to help people I care about while also doing woodworking, something that 
                I've enjoyed ever since building Pinewood Derby cars as a Cub Scout. In addition, I got to plan a project and oversee a large group of people 
                to complete it over a several-month timespan. This was a really valuable experience for a good cause that I was glad to come by at such a young age.</p>
